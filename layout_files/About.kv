Although a recent theory in the field of Alzheimer’s research has been developed in order to address significant gaps in the prevention of AD (i.e., the AD exposome),[sup]4[/sup] programs utilizing it’s tenets have yet to be developed. [b]The significance of the proposed program, especially for the military[/b], is thus: recent research has shown that even individuals with TBI – one of the greatest risk factors for cognitive decline – can decrease their risk of Alzheimer’s disease by modifying lifestyle behaviors, particularly physical activity levels.[sup]5[/sup]\n"
