#:set txt1 "[b]Air Pollution[/b]\nAir pollution is now suspected to play a significant role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.[sup]2[/sup] You can reduce your exposure to air pollution by wearing a protective face mask when going outdoors.[sup]3[/sup]\n\n"

#:set txt2 "[b]Rural-Urban[/b]\nRisk for Alzheimer’s disease is higher in rural than in urban areas.[sup]4[/sup] This disparity may be due to health care inaccessibility or lifestyle factors.[sup]5,6[/sup] If you live in a rural area, you can reduce your risk for Alzheimer’s by engaging in some of the lifestyle behaviors promoted in this program.[sup]6[/sup]\n\n"
#:set txt3 "[b]Diet[/b]\nAlzheimer’s risk may decrease with adoption of a Mediterranean diet, which is measured by the DASH-Q, and includes regular consumption of fish, olive oil, nuts, fruits, vegetables, especially leafy greens, and whole grains.[sup]7[/sup]\n\n"
#:set txt4 "[b]Physical Activity[/b]\nResearch shows that >150 minutes of moderate physical activity (PA) or > 75 minutes of vigorous PA per week may decrease the risk for Alzheimer’s disease.[sup]2[/sup]\n\n"
#:set txt5 "[b]Alcohol Misuse[/b]\nUnhealthy consumption of alcohol, as defined in the screening score interpretation, may increase your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.[sup]4[/sup] Moderate alcohol use, which is not associated with Alzheimer’s, is defined as 1 drink per day for women (and men over 65) and 2 drinks per day for men.\n\n"
#:set txt6 "[b]Depression[/b]\nDepression, defined as having little interest in doing things and feeling down/hopeless more often than not in a 2-week period, is linked to increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[sup]6[/sup] However, research has shown that deep and mindful breathing can reduce self-reported depression symptoms.[sup]7[/sup]\n\n"
#:set txt7 "[b]Age[/b]\nAge is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. One’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease doubles every 5 years after age 65.[sup]2[/sup] However, cognitive decline can be modified by healthy behaviors.\n\n"
#:set txt8 "[b]Sex[/b]\nFemales are at greater risk for Alzheimer’s than males, potentially because females live longer on average.[sup]3[/sup] However, cognitive decline can be modified by behavior.\n\n"
#:set txt9 "[b]Hypertension[/b]\nHigh blood pressure, especially in midlife, is associated with at least an 18% increase in the risk for Alzheimer’s.[sup]4[/sup] The recommendations about diet and exercise in this program may decrease blood pressure,[sup]5[/sup] and thus Alzheimer’s risk.\n\n"
#:set txt10 "[b]Traumatic Brain Injury[/b]\nResearch shows that even mild TBI can increase one’s risk for the onset of Alzheimer’s.[sup]2[/sup] However, individuals with TBI may be able to improve cognitive function with cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT),[sup]3[/sup] in general, and the memory training device called “Operation N-Back,” in particular.[sup]4[/sup]\n\n"
